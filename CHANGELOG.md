# Changelog

All notable changes to TeamStation are documented here. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Repository scaffold: `.gitignore`, MIT `LICENSE`, `README.md`.
- `ROADMAP.md` populated with P0 / P1 / P2 feature prioritization from deep research.
- `docs/teamviewer-reference.md` — CLI parameter table, URI handler matrix, CVE-2020-13699 hardening rules, mode-selection decision table, Web API sync endpoints, install-path discovery order.
- `CLAUDE.md` (local-only) — working notes, corrected CLI reference, must-spike risks.

### Notes
- No runtime code yet. First working build will land as `v0.1.0`.
- Two feasibility spikes queued before architecture is committed: silent-launch behavior of `--PasswordB64` on TV 15.58+, and URI-handler param survival post-CVE-2020-13699.
